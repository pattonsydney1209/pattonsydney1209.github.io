           Stealth is a fictional, online underwear company designed for men in mind. The branding project helped me learn how to combine multiple support pieces into one identity.

           Stealth’s key design concept is sleekness and simplicity, seen in the choice of packaging, limited colors, and typography. Silver foil is added to enhance the perception of luxury.

           For about seven months, a fellow designer, myself and a professor who functioned as our art director, brainstormed, planned, organized, and branded for Ball State University’s 81st Annual Student Art Show.
           <br>
           <br>
Our medium of choice involved tape, and a whole lot of it! My partner and I worked tiredlessly advertising information to get art students interested and involved with entering into
           the show. We used methods to better get our audience’s attention and take notice of the event. In previous years, submissions had been low and there was not a strong attendence at the opening reception. For this year, we wanted to dramatically change what it meant to be a part of the Student Art Show and what it means to be a part of the Ball State School of Art.</p>

       Splish Splash soaps challenged me to create packaging of a common product that could appeal to three different age groups. Audience research played a key role in the development of each type of packaging. The age groups were twenty-year-olds, forty-year-olds, and sixty-year-olds.

       <p id="description">Annually, the Ravinia Women’s Board hosts a poster contest for the Ravinia Music Festival that occurs all summer long in Highland Park, IL. I was pleased to find out that I was their 2016 third place winner. The Ravinia Festival is known to be the oldest music festival in the United States. The venue is popular for it’s a diverse representation of musical genres that include rock and roll, classical, jazz, and much more.
<br> 
<br>      
The imagery and composition of this poster gives off an elegant, yet, playful and lively tone. Various hand-drawn instruments take the shape of Ravinia’s unique logo. The different musical instruments placed inside the logo represent the very thing that makes the festival stand
out from the rest: Ravinia’s diversity in music. The background is black to replicate the bold black outlines that are seen in the Ravinia logo. Additionally, the black gives off a sophisticated look, demonstrating the festival’s timelessness.</p>

       <p id="description">
           The goal behind this assignment was to design a calendar, but there was a catch. We could
not utilize the traditional grid system that most calendars today use and had to find a creative way to use a yearly calendar without one. In my mind, a three-dimensional approach seemed to be the most logical solution to avoid a grid and stepped me outside of my comfort zone to create something that was going to be three- dimensionally designed.
<br>
<br>
For each day the user of this calendar would move one of the numbered beads across the wire to the opposite side and a small peg would be moved
for the days of the week. Small wooden signs contained the months and year, which could be changed easily as time passed. All of the imagery, text, and numbers were wood burned by hand. This particular calendar stands out from traditional ones by not only avoiding a grid system, but also by visually demonstrating the passage of time.

       <p id="description">
         Near the end of 2015, American Structurepoint celebrated their 50th anniversary as a company. Previous to this date, the Senior Designer asked me to design a logo to honor this event. I designed the logo to be bold, but not too flashy. The 50th anniversary logo had to pair with the company’s original logo, so I did not want it to be overpowering.
         <br>
         <br>
The five and zero are formed using negative space around a rectangle. I used a rectangular shape
to represent the durability of the company and it imitated the squares in the company’s original logo. Just recently, a banner drop ceremony was held
to commemorate the 50th anniversary outside American Structurepoint’s corporate office.

       <p id="description">For this film photography project, the idea
was to utilize experimental methods when developing and finishing our photographs. Using photographs I had taken of my younger sisters, I played with positve and negative space. Instead
of placing the entire print in developer, I used
a paint brush to drip it onto the surface of the paper in splatter-like motion. I then drew on top of the prints with white and black ink to add to the graphical look of the prints.</p>
